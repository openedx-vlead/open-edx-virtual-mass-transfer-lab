<h1 style="color: #990000;">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE :</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">1. The distillation flask is filled with 100 ml of sample.<br /> 2. Water in the cooling bath is replaced and cleaned properly for effective cooling.Ice is placed in the cooling bath for removal of heat produced. <br /> 3. The distillation flash and the recieving cylinder are fitted to the input and output of the cooling bath by connecting pipe.Thermometer is inserted to distillation flask.<br /> 4. To reduce evaporation loss due to leakage,the various joints in the arrangement (such as distillation lfask - connection pipe and cooling bath output - recieving cylinde) are sealed properly using some paper.<br /> 5. After all arrangements are completed,heater is switched on and heat is supplied at constant and standard rate for proper vaporization.<br /> 6. The temperature is noted when first drop of liquid condensed is recieved at the recieving cylinder.After that temperature for each 5 ml rise in volume of distillate is noted.<br /> 7. Final boiling point temperature is noted when no further liquid is recieved at the cylinder,though heat is supplied at the same rate.Then we stop heating and final volume is recorded.<br /> 8. The residue is cooled,and measured using a measuring cylinder.Thus subtracting from total volume to volume distillate we get the loss.</p>
